<i>Below is a statement delivered November 2018 to the Euro-Bioimaging Industry
Board regarding the support of proprietary file formats by Bio-Formats. This
was discussed during the</i><a href="https://www.embl.de/training/events/2018/IMJ18-01/">
From Images to Knowledge with ImageJ & Friends</a> <i>meeting in
December and since then, there have been a growing number of conversations
about a common format for bioimaging data. We're posting it here to tie the
conversations back together and continue an open discussion of this critical
issue.</i>

<hr/>

As many of you know, work on Bio-Formats began in 2006, and over the first 10
years of development, support was added for over 140 file formats. If you
include the per-format variants that have emerged over the years, that might be
as much as 5 or 10 times higher, but precise numbers are difficult at best.

In 2016, we issued [a public
statement](https://blog.openmicroscopy.org/file-formats/community/2016/01/06/format-support/)
that OME, or more specifically its funding model, was not going to keep up with
the accelerated development of new formats. We warned that we would be spending
less time on closed formats, and we suggested that format developers either
move to open formats or invest their own time or money to support their formats.

How did that turn out? Well, two years later the growth curve has naturally
levelled off as we pursue other priorities. Currently there are just over 150
formats supported. One company, 3i, has taken over support of their own file
format
([Slidebook6](https://www.intelligent-imaging.com/technical-answers#SLDinFIJI))
with a closed source reader that lives outside of Bio-Formats.

A few other companies have added support for their format either by
contributing directly to the library or by commissioning Glencoe Software to
do so. Where necessary, the open source team has added support for formats
that are needed for their funded priorities like datasets published in the
Image Data Resource.[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]<sup>,</sup>[^4]

<blockquote>Paying for the initial cost of a format is not enough.</blockquote>

But paying for the initial cost of a format is not enough. The need for
indefinite support carries a larger, longer-lived price tag that leaves data
written in a given format constantly at risk. These costs are exacerbated by
format variants. Even when a format is defined following standards like DICOM,
there is a need to contend with multiple implementations as is the case in the
radiology domain. The same happened with the Olympus OIR format added in 2017
in partnership with Olympus Europe. Following public release, the community has
periodically reported breakages caused by new variants of the format.

<blockquote>Put simply, the format landscape has scaled beyond a manageable level.</blockquote>

Put simply, the format landscape has scaled beyond a manageable level. The
result is that scientists end up blocked in accessing and properly handling
their data, and thus blocked in their scientific endeavor. If Bio-Formats were
to cease to exist, a large percentage of imaging data would immediately cease
to be accessible at least until someone took on the burden of support.

We understand the push to develop new formats. From numerous interactions, we
know how crucial it is for data producers to be able to write data quickly as well
as it is for users to be able to access their data quickly, and both across as many
platforms as possible. We also know that, optimally, this ecosystem should all
just keep working for years to come. But while these requirements need to be
fulfilled, something must give.

<blockquote>We think the only scalable way forward is to work together on an ever smaller
number of formats.</blockquote>

We think the only scalable way forward is to work together on an ever smaller
number of formats. That's why we've been concentrating on open formats instead
of adding new proprietary formats. For example, [Bio-Formats
6.1](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/2019/05/20/bio-formats-6-1-0.html) adds
support for the open BigDataViewer (BDV) format, a strong candidate for support
across the community.

BDV provides a testbed for moving beyond the current single binary format of
OME-TIFF. The OME Model will be extended to permit describing the multiscale,
multidimensional data that is currently stored in BDV XML/H5. As a stable
container format, HDF5 allows us a quick way to validate these concepts.

At the same time there's a consensus that HDF5 itself as currently implemented
cannot be the only binary container for our community, and, therefore, we are
also collaborating on next-generation open-source, chunked (or "cloud") formats
for the scale of data generated by future acquisition systems. Two candidates —
[Zarr](http://zarr-developers.github.io) and
[N5](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5) — were independently developed but
overlap in most of their core concepts. Both communities have since begun
[work](https://zarr-developers.github.io/zarr/specs/2019/06/19/zarr-v3-update.html)
on a common storage spec, and other groups from
[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf-and-native-cloud-storage)
to [Pangeo](https://medium.com/pangeo/continuously-extending-zarr-datasets-c54fbad3967d)
are getting involved.

<blockquote>We would like to see a community agreement between the various parties on a minimal
set of open formats covering a broad range of imaging modalities.</blockquote>

We would like to see the bioimaging community agree on set of open formats covering
a broad range of imaging modalities. We need to reduce long-term cost of our
domain's file formats and their variants. We want data users and producers
to be able to ensure the long-term viability of their data.

OME-TIFF has been available for over a decade and today is in use by software
across industry and academia, minimally as an export format, but it still
doesn't have the traction to stop a proliferation of new file formats. As
support for this new binary format solidifies, we intend to invest long-term
support in a new OME format.

Some of this work is the regular work of supporting the bioimaging
community, but we feel this is a larger effort that could use more collaboration
and funding. We are considering an application to the CZI's [Essential Open Source Software
call ](https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/czi-announces-support-for-open-source-software-efforts-to-improve-biomedical-imaging/)
and welcome any coordinated efforts. Beyond that, a truly common format
will need indefinite support, and we will continue to look for avenues to do
so.
