This blog is an update about what we are working on in the OME Files and
Bio-Formats codebase for the next few months.

## OME Files/Bio-Formats status update

Following our [Data Model post](http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/file-formats/data-model/future-plans/2016/01/26/bf-model-status/),
we spent the first semester of 2016 working on a new version of the OME Data
Model which was released in [June 2016](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/schemas/june-2016.html).
This schema release was then followed by two releases in August 2016:

-  the release of our reference implementation for the OME file formats,
   [OME Files C++ 0.2.0](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/news/release-of-ome-files-c-0.2.0)
   with full support for all versions of the OME Data Model
-  the release of [Bio-Formats 5.2.0](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/news/release-of-bio-formats-5.2.0)
   including upgrade to the 2016-06 model, API additions and bug fixes.

Since August, a series of patch releases have been delivered both for OME
Files C++ 0.2.x and Bio-Formats 5.2.x. These releases extended the
C++ reference implementation to support all modalities of OME-TIFF allowed by
our format specification, and also provided a series of bug fixes for the
community following a major release.

In addition, we also performed a [minor release](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/schemas/june-2016-2.html)
of the OME Data Model extending the [AcquisitionMode enumeration](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/Documentation/Generated/OME-2016-06/ome_xsd.html#Channel_AcquisitionMode)
to support new values.

Since the beginning of October 2016, our focus has switched to the development
of Bio-Formats 5.3.0. This release includes two major parts: a re-architecture
of the components and new backwards-compatible API additions.

## Bio-Formats 5.3.0

As part of the development of OME Files, a large part of the C++ code
constituting the reference implementation has been migrated out of the
Bio-Formats repository into its own set of components.

In Bio-Formats 5.3.0, we will be applying a similar re-architecture effort for
our Java codebase and the OME Data Model. While Bio-Formats has been
historically a large multi-module project, the idea here is to facilitate
development and shorten build time, provide a better separation of the
functional components and allow faster releases of the low-level components.
In particular the following components have been filtered out to their own
repository and will be managed separately:

-  [OME I/O classes and functions](https://github.com/ome/ome-common-java)
-  [OME Data Model](https://github.com/ome/ome-model) including the schema
   specification and the generated code in Java and C++
-  some OME forks used by Bio-Formats for reading proprietary files including
   [Apache POI](https://github.com/ome/ome-poi) and
   [MDB Tools](https://github.com/ome/ome-mdbtools)


All decoupled components have been released and uploaded to the
[Maven Central repository](http://search.maven.org/) under the
`org.openmicroscopy` groupId.

Bio-Formats 5.3.0 will also include API additions. In order to minimize the
impact of these changes, the codebase is migrating towards
[semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). This means that all the API added
in 5.3.0 will be fully backwards-compatible and should require no changes for
consumers using Bio-Formats 5.2.0. Two main parts of the API will be reviewed
and extended in 5.3.0:

-  [API allowing passing options](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.2.4/api/loci/formats/in/MetadataOptions.html) to the reader
-  API for writing in tiles

## Timeline

We hope to release Bio-Formats version 5.3.0 at the beginning of December 2016.
