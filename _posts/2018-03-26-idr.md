Nature Research journal [*Scientific Data*](https://www.nature.com/sdata/) is
a peer-reviewed, open-access journal for descriptions of scientifically
valuable datasets, and research that advances the sharing and reuse of
scientific data. These data descriptors provide a path for publishing datasets
associated with scientific publications.

*Scientific Data* requires that all datasets related to a data descriptor,
including experimental, computational and curated data, should be submitted to
an appropriate open, public community repository. Although *Scientific Data*
mandates the release of the datasets that accompany their manuscripts, they do
not themselves host data. Instead, they encourage submission of data to
community-recognized data repositories where possible.

The [Image Data Resource](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/) (IDR), the
worldâ€™s largest public bioimage database, is now
[recommended by *Scientific Data* as a repository for bioimaging data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories#imaging).
Authors wishing to submit a data
descriptor that includes imaging data will be asked to deposit the data in one
of the image data repositories that now include IDR. IDR accepts reference
image datasets (as defined at
[IDR Submissions](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/submission.html)).
Datasets that are not reference images can be published using data archives
(e.g. [BioStudies](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/) or
[Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org/)) or, if appropriate, any of the other
imaging data repositories recommended by *Scientific Data* (e.g.
[EM DataBank](http://www.emdatabank.org/),
[Cancer Imaging Archive](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/),
[SICAS Medical Image Repository](http://www.smir.ch/), or
[Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank](http://www.cxidb.org/)). Datasets published
in IDR will receive a Data DOI that should then be included during the
*Scientific Data* manuscript submission process. This follows the
successful publication in IDR of the
[imaging data](http://dx.doi.org/10.17867/10000104) for a *Scientific Data* 
data descriptor by
[Pascual-Vargas *et al*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.18) on the role
of Rho GTPases in triple negative breast cancer.

The *Scientific Data* repository list is
[mirrored](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/repositories/12327124)
for use by other Springer Nature journals and is therefore also available for
use by authors submitting to other Springer Nature journals. As an example, an
article published by [Kilpinen *et al*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22403)
in *Nature* is supported by
[imaging data](http://dx.doi.org/10.17867/10000107) that has been archived in
IDR.

We look forward to publishing many more imaging datasets associated with
*Scientific Data* and other Springer Nature articles now that this partnership
is officially launched!
