title: Ending Java 6 support

Following our [published roadmap for Java support](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5.1/sysadmins/version-requirements.html#java)
we are ending support for Java 6 with the release of OMERO and Bio-Formats 5.2
later this year.

## We are not alone

This will potentially affect users of the ImageJ plugins for Bio-Formats and
OMERO-ImageJ (OMERO.ij). Note that Java 6 has been unsupported since February
2013 and will [no longer work with MacOS X after 10.11](https://java.com/en/download/help/java_6.html).
This change is also being made by other ImageJ plugin developers.

## Version support

Our current and planned support for Java 6 and Java 7 is as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Bio-Formats and OMERO</th>
        <th>Minimum Java</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5.0 (old)</td>
        <td>1.6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5.1 (current)</td>
        <td>1.6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5.2 (forthcoming)</td>
        <td>1.7</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The change for 5.2 will affect ImageJ and Fiji with a bundled version
of Java 6, and users of non-bundled ImageJ and Fiji who
have Java 6 provided by the operating system (this includes older
Linux distributions providing OpenJDK6).

## What to do

In all cases, it should be possible to download a 1.7 or 1.8 JRE for
your platform from
[Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html),
or alternatively install OpenJDK 7 or 8 for supported platforms.

One exception is older and unsupported versions of MacOS X (10.6 and
earlier), however support for these versions was already dropped with
the [5.1 release](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5.1/sysadmins/version-requirements.html#unix-macos-x).

**If you upgrade the system's version of Java, you can then run a
version of ImageJ or Fiji without a bundled JVM.**

### ImageJ bundle users

Users of ImageJ with a bundled JVM may [download a new version](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html) either using the "platform
independent" version without a bundled JRE, or download the MacOS X or
Windows versions with a bundled Java 8. These are marked as
experimental, but our testing has shown them to be perfectly
functional with the Bio-Formats and OMERO.ij plugins.

### Fiji users

Fiji for "all platforms (no JREs)" will work with the system Java 7 or
Java 8. The Fiji downloads for individual platforms currently provide
Java 6, but will be bundled with Java 8 in the near future.
For now, the "all platforms (no JREs)" download is recommended.

## If you can't upgrade

Users who are unable or unwilling to upgrade their Java to version 7
or later will be able to continue to use the 5.1 and earlier releases
of Bio-Formats and OMERO with ImageJ, both of which will retain Java 6
support for their lifetime. However, we do not intend to back-port new
features and would always recommend you use a Java version with security
support.
