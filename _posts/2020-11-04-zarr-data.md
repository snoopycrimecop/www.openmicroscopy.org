The OME team is leading a community effort to design a new cloud-friendly "Next Generation" file format (NGFF).
See the [announcement](https://forum.image.sc/t/next-generation-file-formats-for-bioimaging/31361)
and other image.sc posts tagged with [ome-ngff](https://forum.image.sc/tag/ome-ngff).

The [ome-zarr spec](https://github.com/ome/omero-ms-zarr/blob/master/spec.md) is currently
under development and includes a changelog with version numbers.
A [number of tools](https://github.com/ome/omero-ms-zarr/blob/master/related.md) are being developed
to work with ome-zarr data. The [vizarr](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vizarr) viewer is used below to view OME-Zarr images.

As part of this work, we are converting sample datasets from
[Image Data Resource (IDR)](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)
into OME-Zarr, to correspond to each version of the spec.
These are publicly available and hosted on S3 storage in the [Embassy Cloud](https://www.embassycloud.org/)
at the [European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/).
Below are listed Images converted into version 0.1 of the OME-Zarr spec. This list is also available in
[JSON format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ome/blog/master/_data/zarr_data_2020-11-04.json).

We are currently working on a spec for representing HCS data in OME-Zarr. When this spec is finalised, we
will also provide links to sample HCS data in this format.
