For those of you who couldn’t make it to Dundee for OME 2016, or maybe just
didn’t get to all the sessions you wanted to, we have a range of content on
our downloads site--notes, slides and even movie versions of workshop
presentations--available to browse from
[downloads.openmicroscopy.org/presentations/2016/Users-Meeting/](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/presentations/2016/Users-Meeting/) or
linked via the [programme page](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community/minutes/meetings/11th-annual-users-meeting-2016) if there is specific content you’re interested in.

One of the things the user meeting is really valuable for is hearing about
what the rest of the community is doing with our tools so the
[lightning talks](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/presentations/2016/Users-Meeting/Lightning-Talks/)
have been a really valuable edition to the format over the past two years. 
Together with the [formal talks](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/presentations/2016/Users-Meeting/Talks/),
this year’s examples illustrate people doing everything from archiving
to data visualization to image processing, from the scale of individual
institutions to international research collaborations.

It’s always great to hear positive stories from the community rather than only
getting feedback when something needs fixing. To this end, we’d always invite
you to make use of the
[mailing lists](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community/mailing-lists)
and [forums](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/community/) to discuss the
challenges you’re working on even if you don’t necessarily need help. We’d
also be keen to feature your stories on this blog if you’d like to submit
something longer e.g. with screenshots - you can open a PR at
[github.com/ome/blog/](https://github.com/ome/blog/) or just drop us
an email and we’ll get back to you for details. Did you know we maintain a
list of publications using our tools on
[www.openmicroscopy.org/site/about/publications](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/about/publications)? We are always happy to hear of new citations
to add.

An even newer addition this year was the Unconference sessions on the third
day. Again, we’ve put some notes from the session up on our
[downloads site](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/presentations/2016/Users-Meeting/Unconference/).
The topics covered in the
[Technical Developer discussions](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/presentations/2016/Users-Meeting/Unconference/TechnicalDeveloperDiscussions.pdf) include data pipelines,
federation and scaling, while the
[Admining OMERO section](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/presentations/2016/Users-Meeting/Unconference/AdminingOMERO.pdf)
is more about managing data and users, having grown out of a session aimed at
facility managers.

The [File Formats discussion](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/presentations/2016/Users-Meeting/Unconference/FileFormatDiscussions.pdf)
provides a good example of how we carry issues raised forward. The
Unconference session on Reader integration and decentralisation prompted the
creation of a [GitHub Design issue](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/design/issues/42) where the
interested members of the community can follow the options we’re considering
and make comments.

If you haven’t noticed our Design repo before, you can find
[Issues](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/design/issues) relating to a whole
range of design scoping for the UI, OMERO.web viewer, Folders etc. You do need
a GitHub account to comment but signing up only requires a valid email
address. Similarly, we have a selection of public Trello boards at
[trello.com/ome](https://trello.com/ome) to help you track what’s
going on with the project, and receive notifications and give feedback if you
sign up for free.

We’ve had some great feedback from the meeting attendees and would love to
carry forward more positive engagement and to help empower our user community
to help each other. We’ll be looking at ways to try to promote the activities
of our community better going forward and in the meantime, please keep in
touch!
