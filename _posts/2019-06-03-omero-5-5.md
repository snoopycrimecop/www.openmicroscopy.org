title: OMERO 5.5 Status Update
tags: future-plans community

After the intensive development period of [IDR’s](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)
first releases, the 5.4 series of OMERO was intended to be a stable platform for the
community and the OME team to build on. From its first release in October 2017 to its
tenth and final release this year, 5.4 has, we think, served as a reference point for
the community.

In trying to maintain that stability, however, it’s become ever more clear that we
need the ability to quickly release individual parts of OMERO to the community.
Fixes to file formats, performance improvements, security patches, and more should
not need to wait on the simultaneous release of the entire OMERO platform.

Enabling such releases has been the focus of the upcoming, largely developer-centric
release. Though with production-quality Docker deployments and the
fresh-off-the-presses Bio-Formats 6.1, we hope that OMERO 5.5 will provide
something for everyone.

### Individual Repositories

During the development of OMERO 5.5, all 800,000+ lines of Java and Matlab code were
migrated out of the [openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy) GitHub repository into individual repositories, each with a new
[Gradle](https://gradle.org) build system. Support for Java 7, Python 2.6 and
Ice 3.5 were dropped. Java 11 support was added. The versions of most of these new
repositories began at 5.5.0, but they have already begun to diverge following
[semver](https://semver.org) principles. Though initially disruptive, we hope this
modernization and modularization will ease participation in the development of OMERO.
See the Gradle super project [omero-build](https://github.com/ome/omero-build) for more details.

### Docker Deployments

Beyond the changes for building OMERO, the distribution of
[OMERO.server](https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-server) and
[OMERO.web](https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-web-standalone/)
as Docker images is now considered production quality. Examples for using these
images in various configurations are available under [omero-deployment-examples](https://github.com/ome/omero-deployment-examples). Both images will be updated with every
OMERO release, and will also be updated with releases of the embedded components
and plugins as necessary.

Other Docker images from the OME team that you may have used over the years
have been deprecated and will soon be removed. A next step will be to
additionally provide [Helm Charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) for easing
deployment on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). If you are interested
please get in touch through the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/omero).

### Bio-Formats 6.1

But don’t worry: we also didn’t forget our users. OMERO 5.5 finally makes the
jump to Bio-Formats 6 both with its support for pyramidal TIFFs
(see [post](http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/file-formats/community/2018/11/29/ometiffpyramid/))
and for new community file formats like BDV, see
[Bio-Formats 6.1 announcement](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/2019/05/20/bio-formats-6-1-0.html)
for more details.
Moving forward, we look forward to helping you to create and share these more
scalable file-formats.


### Beyond

In the coming months, we will continue to release fixes for the individual
components of OMERO and hope to ease their introduction into your local installation.
Feedback on how you find working with the decoupled repositories and installing
changes would be much appreciated.

At the same time, we will begin preparing for the next large changes:

1. With the deprecation of Python 2, all OME code bases will need to be upgraded to
work with Python 3. Likely a similar modularization will be applied to the Python
and Web code such that `pip install -U omero-web` should be all that is needed to
receive the latest updates to OMERO.web.
2. A development version of OMERO will begin with a flexible extension mechanism for
instrument and eventually experiment metadata. This is likely to become the basis for
OMERO 6 which, unlike OMERO 5.5, will require a database upgrade.
3. And, OMERO will finally enter the age of microservices. Thanks to the substantial
work by Glencoe Software, a number of standalone services are already available for
integration into OMERO. See
[omero-ms-pixel-buffer](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/omero-ms-pixel-buffer),
[omero-ms-thumbnail](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/omero-ms-thumbnail),
[omero-ms-image-region](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/omero-ms-image-region),
[omero-ms-core](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/omero-ms-core) and
[omero-ms-backbone](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/omero-ms-backbone).
