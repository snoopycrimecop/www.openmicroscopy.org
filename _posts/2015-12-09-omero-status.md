This is a quick update on the status of various versions of OMERO, and some
discussion about our future development plans and aspirations.

## Releases, maintenance and deprecation

With the [release of OMERO 5.2.0](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/community/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=7922) at
the beginning of November 2015, the current situation with OMERO versions is
as follows:

- The last release of the **OMERO 5.0.x** line was February 2015.  This
  version of OMERO and all earlier ones are now unmaintained - we won’t be
  updating the 5.0.x line of OMERO; anyone who continues to use them does so
  at their own risk.

- **OMERO 5.1.x** is now in “maintenance” - we will provide updates for
  major security issues but we won’t be releasing bug fixes or any performance
  enhancements. To access these, you must upgrade to the 5.2.x line. We expect
  to continue this level of support until the release of OMERO 5.3 (currently
  aimed for Spring 2016).

- **OMERO 5.2.x** is the new stable line and will be updated with bug fixes
  and enhancements as point releases at least until OMERO 5.3 is released. We
  expect to continue to support this line throughout 2016, although this
  support will drop to maintenance level once OMERO 5.3.0 is released.

The best way to keep up-to-date with our release plans is to follow our [public Trello boards](https://trello.com/ome)
 - [‘Getting Started’](https://trello.com/b/4EXb35xQ/getting-started) acts as
a landing board for discovering more specific issue-based boards that may be
of interest to you and gives an overview of upcoming releases with their
current estimated timelines. You can view these boards without signing up but
will need to register for a free Trello account if you want to subscribe to
notifications or comments. You only need to supply a valid email address to 
sign up.

**Our next OMERO release will be 5.2.1**, which will feature bug fixes but
also focus on improving our sysadmin documentation and installation workflows.
We recognise that often groups wishing to use OMERO do not have access to a
dedicated sysadmin and are trying to alleviate the burden as much as possible.
You can follow progress on the [OMERO 5.2.1 board](https://trello.com/b/HdHaudmw/omero-5-2-1).

## What’s next?

With OMERO’s use expanding in numbers and in breadth of domains, we are
focussing our efforts on making OMERO even more powerful - ensuring that it
provides proper facilities for more and more types of image data and metadata,
and that it can be deployed in increasingly complex and heterogeneous
configurations. Some of our longer term goals:

- We have applied for funding to develop OMERO’s “federation” capabilities, to
  make it possible for multiple OMERO servers to be connected at the level of
  clients or servers.
- For some time we have wanted to re-architect the framework we use for our
  OMERO.web and OMERO.insight clients and are seeking funding to do so.
- Making Bio-Formats and OMERO work effectively with object stores is a major
  priority.
- We aim to re-build OMERO’s image rendering engine, to make it faster, more
  powerful and able to support the creation of increasingly complex data
  visualisations.

As always, there is a long list of things to do, and we always appreciate any
feedback or comments on our work, goals or directions. All of this work is
aimed at improving and expanding OME’s support for the heterogeneous metadata
which is the foundation of much of modern science (an early vision of the
requirements that drive our work was [published by Jim Gray and colleagues](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64537/tr-2005-10.pdf)).
Comments welcome on our [Trello boards](https://trello.com/ome) or via our
other [community channels](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/community/).

In the shorter term, the bulk of our work involves improvements to metadata
handling, especially for regions of interest (ROIs) and analytic metadata. We
have been working with several use cases, especially involving
super-resolution localisation microscopy (PALM, STORM, dSTORM, etc), high
content screening (HCS) and digital pathology, to define common requirements
for handling the metadata generated by manual and automatic processing of
image data from these different modalities. A discussion of super-resolution
data storage (e.g. [this thread on the ome-devel mailing list](http://lists.openmicroscopy.org.uk/pipermail/ome-devel/2015-October/003471.html))
has helped drive this, as has our ongoing work on publishing large image
datasets on the BBSRC-funded [Image Data Resource (IDR)](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org)[^1]) and participation in several
ongoing data-focussed projects (e.g. [MULTIMOT](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/634107) and
[CORBEL](https://www.elixir-europe.org/news/corbel-sets-out-establish-common-infrastructure-biomedical-research)).
We have already built defined tools for metadata import into the IDR (see the
[code repository](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/idr-metadata)) and will
aim to harmonize these with other projects that are collecting metadata on
scientific datasets (e.g. [BioStudies](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/)).
Import of metadata from spreadsheets and other text-based tabular formats will
be supported, but we will also be supporting more modern, powerful data
formats (e.g. HDF5).  We will use new resources that provide online services
for controlled vocabularies (e.g. EBI's [Ontology Lookup Service](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/beta/)).

But next, we want to make ROIs first class
citizens in OME’s applications. This means we will add an 'ROI Folder'
concept, which will allow users and analytic tools to cluster ROIs just like
they already do with images and tags. All of these new capabilities will start
to appear in OMERO 5.3 (currently scheduled for Spring 2016) and in several
point releases through 2016.
