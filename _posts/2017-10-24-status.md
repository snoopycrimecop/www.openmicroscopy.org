## The year so far...

2017 has been a very busy year for the OME team so far with:
 
- **2 major OMERO releases** plus 6 security or patch releases - introducing
  ROI Folders, a whole new UI layout for HCS data, a configurable restricted
  admin user role and many other fixes and improvements
- **12 Bio-Formats releases** to date (and another in the pipeline) -
  featuring 2 new formats and improved support for many more
- **4 OME Files C++ releases** - improving support for reading and writing
  OME-TIFF in an open, liberally-licensed, native library
- **4 OMERO.figure releases** - adding support for loading ROIs and choosing
  look-up tables from OMERO, using markdown syntax for italics and bold
  labels, setting background colors, plus other fixes and improvements
- **various other web app releases** - all now available from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=omero&submit=search),
  including OMERO.FPBioimage, a volumetric visualization tool
- **the launch of our new OMERO.iviewer** - a web browser-based interactive
  multidimensional image viewing app that includes ROI drawing and measurement
  functionality. OMERO.iviewer is approaching a full v1.0 release, a sign of
  our commitment to maintaining and growing the functionality in this app
- AND a [new website](https://www.openmicroscopy.org)! 

Plus of course, our usual Annual User Meeting bringing together members of the
community from across the globe (if you couldn’t make it, talks and workshops
are available from the [event page](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/events/12th-annual-users-meeting-2017.html)). 

The [Image Data Resource](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/) (IDR) also continues
to go from strength to strength. If you missed it, our 
[Nature Methods paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4326) (or the open
access [PubMedCentral version](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5536224/))
discusses how the IDR can be used to obtain new biological insights from
existing datasets, plus an in-depth explanation of how the resource is set up.
It also includes information on how you can set up your own IDR. 

With all that, hopefully you’ll forgive us for neglecting this blog!

## What's still to come...

We’re running two days of [Bioinformatics training at Cambridge University](https://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/event/2239247)
in December. In the run up to this, we’ll be developing new training materials
which will all be available via our website for those of you who can’t attend.
We’ll also be expanding our collection of Jupyter notebooks providing you with
examples of how to carry out image analysis via the OMERO API and likely
adding to our collection of how-to movies on
[our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyySB9ZzNi8aBGYqcxSrauQ).
The IDR will also be updated, publishing several new datasets (our first light
sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset is almost ready to go!) and improvements
to the Jupyter analysis tools.

In terms of releases, we expect to put out patch releases for OMERO,
Bio-Formats and OME Files. As always the content of these will be driven by
both the community and our own projects, for example the IDR continues to
challenge us in terms of format support and display, and the way our tools
connect and interact with analysis packages. You can always keep up with the
latest upcoming releases and more via our
[Trello boards](https://trello.com/b/4EXb35xQ/getting-started) (you can
[sign up here](https://trello.com/invite/b/4EXb35xQ/ec7fdd2ec30b8bb070bb3d9d2ecac3f5/getting-started) with just an email address).

Beyond this, we are continuing to push forward our functionality and the scale
at which our tools operate. As imaging technology takes huge leaps in scale,
this is challenging to say the least and we’ll need the support of the
community more than ever. If you have resources to contribute, we’d love you
to get involved - [write to the mailing lists or forums](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/support/),
check out our [contributing developer docs](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/contributing/),
read our [blog posts on helping us support new file formats](http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/categories/#file-formats). Even if you
don’t have resources to spare, you can always help us secure grant funding by
[citing our work](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/citing-ome/) in your
publications.
